## Preprocessing Model Data

To preprocess the model data, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the `preprocessor.py` script by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    python preprocessor.py
    ```

    This script will process the model data and perform any necessary preprocessing steps.

4. Once the script finishes running, the processed data will be available for further analysis or model training.
